Weather Data Analysis – Rainfall & Temperature
📌 Project Objective

Analysis of one-year Toronto weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions) and visualization for specific time periods

    Data cleaning & preprocessing
    Convert Date/Time to datetime
    Set datetime as index
    Feature selection
    Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Weather Condition
    Statistical analysis
    Average temperature, Max wind speed
    Warmest & most humid day
    Rainfall detection
    Create binary rainfall column (0 = No, 1 = Rain/Snow)
    Time range filtering
    Focus on January 2012
    Visualizations
    Line chart → Temperature trend
    Bar chart → Rainfall events
